  *
  * You want to build a word cloud, an infographic where the size of a word corresponds to how often it appears in the body of text.
  * *
  * To do this, you'll need data. Write code that takes a long string and builds its word cloud data in a dictionary â†´ , where the keys are words and the values are the number of times the words occurred.
  * *
  * Think about capitalized words. For example, look at these sentences:
  * 'After beating the eggs, Dana read the next step:'
  * 'Add milk and eggs, then add flour and sugar.'
  * What do we want to do with "After", "Dana", and "add"? In this example, your final dictionary should include one "Add" or "add" with a value of 22. Make reasonable (not necessarily perfect) decisions about cases like "After" and "Dana".
  * *
  * Assume the input will only contain words and standard punctuation.
  * *
  * You could make a reasonable argument to use regex in your solution. We won't, mainly because performance is difficult to measure and can get pretty bad.
